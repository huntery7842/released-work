# Ghost Ship: Nightmare Mod

## Overview
Ghost ship Nightmare comes with a Ghost Ship stage more challenging than Ghost Ship : Chaos(GSC) or Ghost Ship vanilla. The mod also contains other enhanced abyss stages.

The goal was to create a ghost ship stage and abyss stages that are challenging but possible to complete either solo or with a partner. 

The initial build of this mod was based on Commander Fox's GSC mod but subsequently more extensive changes were made across the board. Current version is **v0.30 beta**.

Difficulty: 5/5 very difficult
